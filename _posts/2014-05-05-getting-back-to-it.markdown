Being involved in an early-stage startup from inception through to a point where a basic foundation has (hopefully) been achieved is an all-consuming thing, as anyone who has done it would understand and no-doubt agree. Many timres over the past three years in particular, I have been various had, or been exposed to, ideas and learnings that I have wanted to communicate, share or simply note down for reference at the time. Regrettably the demands on my time (and perhaps more importantly, my energy) have seen me completely drop off the blogging bandwagon. This is something that I regret and that want to fix. So, without further ado, I have decided that it's time to brush the cobwebs off on the trusty old samizdat and crank the rusty handle once again. Wish me luck!

After a little looking round at options I've decided to go for a minimalist solution using the Jekyll[jekyll] tool and Github Pages[github-pages] as host. I just don't feel that I need the bells and whistles of a full-blown platforms such as WP, or even the lighter-weight Ruby-based options, most of which of which require a host to be configured (a hassle!) and maintained (much worse!)

I wish to prevent accidental complexity impeding my desired outcome of getting more content online, more quickly, and more often.I considered hosted options but Jekyll looks like a good solution from a technical perspective. It's also hard to argue with _free_. I like the flexible choice of deployment options (sftp, s3, and Github Pages for example) and the fact that what is essentially static content resides on the web, rather than parked in a backend database. Lastly I figure if it's good enough for Werner[werner] and Tom[tpw] (and thousands of others) then it's good enough for me. We'll see how it goes.
