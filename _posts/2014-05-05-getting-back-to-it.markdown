Being involved in an early-stage startup from inception through to a point where a basic foundation has seemingly been established is a rewarding yet consuming life experience. Many times over the past three years I have had ideas, insights or experiences that I've wanted to share, or simply to record for my own reference. Regrettably in that time I've dropped off the blogging bandwagon entirely. Utter radio silence.

It's time for a change. Without further ado, I've decided to brush the cobwebs off the old _digital samizdat_ and to crank the rusty handle once again. Hopefully something other than dirty old grease will emerge. Bear with me!

The first step in getting (re)started was to choose a blogging platform. After a review of various options (and the technical and design philosophies that underpinned them) I have decided to adopt the minimalist approach, with [Jekyll][jekyll] for static content generation and [Github Pages][gh-pages] for hosting. My goal was to avoid [accidental complexity][ac] at all costs.

For me, the simplicity of Jekyll won the day. I liked the ease of content creation. I liked the flexible choice of backend hosts (sftp, S3, and Github Pages).  I liked the the prospective ease of migration between hosts, if required. I also figured that if it's good enough for [Werner][vogels] and [Tom][tpw] (and many others) then it should be good enough for me. Certainly it will do for now. Onwards.
